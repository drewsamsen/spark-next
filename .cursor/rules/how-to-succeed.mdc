- Before you start each task, look in `.cursor/rules` for useful guidelines. 
- Find and read the mdc files that are relevant to the task at hand.
- never try to run databse migrations
- When implementing new features, we do not need to maintain backwards compatibility unless specifically mentioned in the request
- Always clean up code and files that are no longer needed
- to copy a file, always use `cp`
- to move a file, always use `mv`
