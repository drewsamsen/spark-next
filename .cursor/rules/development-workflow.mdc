## Workflow

- After all changes are made, ALWAYS build the project with `npm run build`. Ignore warnings, fix errors.
- Do not over-deliver. If you see opportunities for a good next step, pause and make the suggestion to the user. 
- Do not automatically try and do too much.
- Never try to run the development server yourself. Never run `npm run dev`
- If the user requests A, do not deliver A, B, C, and D.  Instead, complete A, and when you're finished, recommend the next steps of B, C, and D for the user to decide how to proceed next.

## Version Control and git

- Do not run `git add` or `git commit` after making changes. 
- The user will handle git.

## Debugging 

- When debugging, Avoid a shotgun approach where you make many changes at once to try to fix the issue.
- Think carefully, step by step, and identify the most probable cause of the issue and make that one fix only.
- The user can test after each attempted fix and we can iterate from there.  Avoid trying too many fixes at once.
