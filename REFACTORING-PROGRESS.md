# Refactoring Progress

## Repository-Service-Hook Architecture Refactoring

We've been refactoring the codebase to follow a clean architecture pattern:
- **Repositories**: Handle direct database access
- **Services**: Implement business logic using repositories
- **Hooks**: Provide React components with access to services
- **Components**: Use hooks to access services

## Components Refactored

1. **BookHighlights**: 
   - Added the `useHighlightsService` hook
   - ✅ Partial refactoring complete

2. **ScheduledTasksTable**:
   - Replaced direct Supabase calls with `authService`
   - Replaced API calls with `integrationsService` methods
   - ✅ Refactoring complete

3. **NestedSidebar**:
   - Created new `sidebarService` to handle sidebar-related functionality
   - Moved sorting, filtering, and localStorage operations to the service
   - ✅ Refactoring complete

4. **FunctionLogsTable**:
   - Created new `functionLogsRepository` for database access
   - Created new `functionLogsService` for business logic
   - Created new `useFunctionLogsService` hook for React components
   - Replaced direct API calls with service methods
   - Simplified pagination and filtering logic
   - ✅ Refactoring complete

5. **Left-Sidebar**:
   - Enhanced `sidebarService` with sidebar width management
   - Replaced direct UI context usage with service methods
   - Centralized localStorage operations in the service
   - ✅ Refactoring complete

6. **SparkPreviewPanel**:
   - Verified using `useSparksService` and `useCategorization` hooks
   - Ensured consistent service usage for data fetching and manipulation
   - ✅ Refactoring complete

## Services Implemented

1. **Sidebar Service** (renamed from UI Service):
   - Handles sidebar-related functionality
   - Provides methods for sorting, filtering, and localStorage management
   - Added sidebar width management capabilities
   - ✅ Implementation complete

2. **Function Logs Service**:
   - Handles function logs retrieval and formatting
   - Implements proper error handling
   - Works with repository layer for data access
   - ✅ Implementation complete

3. **Sparks Service**:
   - Handles creation, retrieval, and updating of sparks
   - Implements proper error handling and validation
   - ✅ Implementation complete

4. **Categorization Service**:
   - Manages tags and categories
   - Provides methods for applying tags/categories to resources
   - ✅ Implementation complete

5. **Highlights Service**:
   - Handles book highlight retrieval and management
   - ✅ Partial implementation complete

6. **Books Service**:
   - Manages book data and operations
   - ✅ Partial implementation complete

7. **Auth Service**:
   - Handles user authentication and session management
   - ✅ Implementation complete

8. **Integrations Service**:
   - Manages external integrations like Readwise
   - Handles synchronization and data import
   - ✅ Implementation complete

## Components Still Needing Refactoring

1. **MainContent**:
   - Currently a static demo component, but as it evolves should use the architecture pattern

2. **Additional components using direct Supabase calls**:
   - Need to identify and refactor components still using direct database access
   - Priority should be given to frequently used and complex components

## Summary of Improvements

The refactoring has made several significant improvements to the codebase:

1. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - Database access is now isolated in repositories
   - Business logic is concentrated in service layers
   - UI components are focused on presentation and user interaction

2. **Code Reusability**:
   - Common operations are now centralized in services
   - Shared functionality is accessible via hooks
   - Consistent patterns make extending the application easier

3. **Maintainability**:
   - Components are simpler and more focused
   - Logic is easier to test and modify
   - Dependencies are explicitly defined

4. **Type Safety**:
   - Strong typing throughout the stack
   - Defined interfaces between layers
   - Better IDE support and compilation checks

## Next Steps

1. **Complete repository implementations**:
   - Finish implementing repositories mentioned in the architecture overview
   - Ensure all repositories follow consistent patterns and error handling

2. **Finalize service layer**:
   - Complete any partial service implementations (Books, Highlights)
   - Add additional services for any remaining entities

3. **Hook standardization**:
   - Create a consistent pattern for all service hooks
   - Ensure proper error handling and loading states in hooks

4. **Component audit**:
   - Systematically review all components for direct database access
   - Create prioritized list of components to refactor

5. **Documentation updates**:
   - Document all services, repositories, and hooks
   - Create usage examples for developers

## Prioritized Action Items

### High Priority (Next 1-2 weeks)
- Complete Books and Highlights service implementations
- Refactor header component
- Conduct component audit to identify any remaining direct database access

### Medium Priority (2-4 weeks)
- Create consistent pattern for API routes using repository/service layer
- Implement testing strategy for repositories and services
- Document service layer for developers

### Low Priority (4+ weeks)
- Performance optimization
- Refactor low-traffic components
- Implement advanced features (caching, background sync)

## Recently Completed Refactoring

1. **RightSidebar**:
   - Created `useSidebarService` hook to replace direct `useUISettings` usage
   - Migrated sidebar width management to the service layer
   - Improved separation of concerns
   - ✅ Refactoring complete

2. **LeftSidebar**:
   - Updated to use `useSidebarService` hook instead of direct service import
   - Fixed build errors related to sidebar width management
   - Ensured consistent pattern with RightSidebar component
   - ✅ Refactoring complete

3. **MainContent**:
   - Created `contentRepository` for future data access
   - Created `contentService` for business logic
   - Created `useContentService` hook for React components
   - Set up pattern for future real data implementation
