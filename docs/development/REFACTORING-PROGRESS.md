## Conclusion

The refactoring effort has significantly improved the codebase organization, maintainability, and type safety. By consistently applying the repository-service-hook pattern across the application, we've reduced technical debt and ensured a cohesive architecture that will support future development efforts.

We've made substantial progress on our high-priority tasks, including:
1. Successfully migrating authentication from direct Supabase calls to our auth service
2. Completing the majority of the categorization module refactoring:
   - Created the categorization repository with extensive functionality
   - Refactored tag-service, category-service, and job-service to use the repository
   - Updated db-utils to use repository methods
3. Updating hooks to use our new architecture pattern

The next steps will focus on:
1. Implementing a dedicated CategoriesRepository to handle category-specific database operations
2. Continuing to migrate remaining components that directly use Supabase
3. Standardizing API utilities and error handling
4. Conducting a comprehensive component audit to ensure consistent patterns
