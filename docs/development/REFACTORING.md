# Spark Application Refactoring and Re-architecture

## Overview

The Spark application, a personal knowledge management system built with Next.js and Supabase, is undergoing a comprehensive refactoring to improve maintainability, scalability, and developer experience. This document tracks our refactoring goals, progress, and next steps.

## Clean Architecture Principles

We're implementing a clean architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns:

- **Repository Layer**: Handles direct database access through Supabase
- **Service Layer**: Implements business logic using repositories
- **React Hooks**: Provides components with access to services
- **Components**: Consume hooks to display UI and handle interactions

This architecture creates a unidirectional data flow: `repository → service → hook → component`

## Codebase Analysis & Issues Identified

### Current Architecture
- **Frontend:** Next.js App Router architecture with React components  
- **Backend:** Supabase for database and authentication  
- **Async Processing:** Inngest for background jobs and task processing  
- **Integration:** External APIs like Readwise for data import  

### Key Issues Identified

1. **Component Structure Issues**
   - Large, monolithic components (300+ lines)
   - Mixed concerns: UI, state management, and API interactions combined
   - Duplicated logic across components

2. **Code Organization**
   - Inconsistent service layer usage
   - Scattered type definitions
   - Missing abstraction layers with components directly calling the database

3. **Architectural Concerns**
   - Limited separation of concerns
   - Mixed data fetching strategies
   - Inconsistent error handling

## Refactoring Strategy & Phases

### Phased Approach

#### Phase 1: Foundation
- Establish service layer abstraction  
- Centralize type definitions  
- Extract UI component library  

#### Phase 2: Component Refactoring
- Break down large components  
- Implement custom hooks  
- Separate data fetching from presentation  

#### Phase 3: State Management
- Implement React Query/SWR  
- Create context providers  
- Standardize error handling  

#### Phase 4: Testing and Optimization
- Add testing infrastructure  
- Performance optimizations  
- Comprehensive documentation
